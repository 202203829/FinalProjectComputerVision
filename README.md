# Computer Vision Project 🚀👁️‍🗨️

Welcome to our awesome Computer Vision repository! This project is divided into three exciting parts, each solving a unique problem in the world of computer vision. Let's dive in! 🌟

## Part 1: Camera Calibration 📸

In the first part, we calibrate the camera to obtain both the **intrinsic** and **extrinsic** parameters of the camera. Calibration is crucial for accurate 3D reconstructions and understanding the camera's perspective. 🧐

We gather:
- **Intrinsic parameters**: These define the internal characteristics of the camera (focal length, principal point, etc.).
- **Extrinsic parameters**: These tell us how the camera is positioned relative to the world.

## Part 2: Shape Detection 🔍

Next up, we move to detecting **ordered shapes**. We identify various figures in the scene (think circles, squares, and other fun geometric shapes). 🟠🔶 These shapes are crucial to unlock the next phase of the project, where they help us assess the security of a private zone! 🎯

## Part 3: Red Alert! 🚨🔴

In the final part, we check if **any red objects** cross into a **restricted zone** (the private area). If any red object crosses the line, the system will trigger an alert! It's like a virtual security guard keeping an eye on everything. 🛑💡

### Features:
- Camera calibration for accurate measurements.
- Shape detection for structured tasks.
- Real-time red zone monitoring.
